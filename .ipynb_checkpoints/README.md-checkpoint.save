# Description:
We are trying to find the best neighborhood by rating each neghborhood in 3 categories: Number of Trees, Cleanliness of Streets, and Amount of Police Incidents. Each neighborhood will be given a rating between 1 to 100 with 1 being the worst and 100 being the best. A computation will then be used to assign each neighborhood
